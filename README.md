# Nim2nix

## Usage

See [fugitive/package.nix](./pkgs/fugitive/package.nix) for an example.

## Motivation

Building packages on `nix` can be annoying.
We want it to be as easy as possible for `nim` users and `nixos` users/maintainers.

## Issue

The current implementation in nixpkgs relies on a custom lock file.
But packages are more likely to have an existing `nimble.lock`,
making maintaining or generating a second lock file just for nix somewhat tedious.

There are currently two options for generating this `lock.json`:

1. Using the recommended [nim_lk](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#nim-lockfiles) which attempts dependency resolution to generate the lock file
2. [nnl](https://github.com/daylinmorgan/nnl) which performs no dependency resolution and simply converts a `nimble.lock` file (or generates one if necessary) to the equivalent `nim_lk` output

## Solution

`nim2nix` forgoes `buildNimPackage` with a custom builder: `buildNimblePackage`.
This builder requires the use of a `nimble.lock` file.
If one does not exist it can be provided by setting nimbleLockFile (see [fugitive example](./pkg/fugitive/package.nix)).
The `nimbledeps` generated by `buildNimblePackage` will be check against `nimbleDepsHash`.
Note that the dependencies are setup using nimble but compilation still occurs by invoking `nim` directly via `nim_builder`.
